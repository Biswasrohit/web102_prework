## Notes

1. **UI/UX Design:**
   - Creating a responsive and intuitive user interface was a significant challenge. Ensuring the app looks and functions well across various devices and screen sizes required careful design and testing.

2. **State Management:**
   - Managing the application's state, especially when dealing with dynamic content and asynchronous data fetching, proved to be complex. Maintaining a consistent and accurate state across different components was critical to the app's functionality.

3. **Backend Integration:**
   - Integrating the app with the backend API required careful handling of data communication and error management. Ensuring that API requests were efficient and secure was a key focus during development.

4. **Debugging and Testing:**
   - Debugging issues and writing comprehensive tests to cover edge cases were ongoing tasks. Ensuring that the app works consistently across different environments, browsers, and devices required a thorough testing strategy.
